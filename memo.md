# What's this?

- notes for why I think it's readable
- it's likely to be glued by commits. so blame notes and find corresponding code.

## spec1

- readers would think "why 'オムライス'?", hence the comment

## spec2

- is it ok to put seminar info and program info in the same README?
  - but I didn't want to bother splitting the app into separate dir
- it's always good to care about versions
- where to set CWD might not be obvious
